# Issue when first try

1. The board in default doesn't equip with a power adapter. They recommend a 12V/2A adapter. Buy it by yourself. Other accessories include Type-C Usb cable, HDMI-LCD (or PC monitor), USB-keyboard/mouse, Ethernet Cable, SD card.

2. adb shell
  a. Fix error: insufficient permissions for device error. refer [link](https://itsfoss.com/fix-error-insufficient-permissions-device/)
  `adb kill-server`
  `sudo /workspace/soft/adb/platform-tools/adb start-server`

3. read only system
  `mount -o rw,remount /system`
  `mount -o ro,remount /system`
