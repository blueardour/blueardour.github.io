# Introduction
Super resolution (SR) is some task in which the input is a low resolution image or blur image and a high resolution or deblur image is required to output. Some researchers solve the problem using deep learning based method. For the super resolution scenario, it could be divided in to single image SR (SISR), multiple frame images SR (MISR) and video SR.
